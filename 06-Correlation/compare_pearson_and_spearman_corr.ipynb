    "## When to Use Pearson Correlation:\n",
    "- **When the relationship is linear**: Pearson correlation is appropriate when you believe there is a straight-line (linear) relationship between the variables.\n",
    "- **When the data is continuous and normally distributed**: Pearson assumes that both variables are normally distributed and are measured on an interval or ratio scale.\n",
    "- **When you need a measure of linear dependence**: Pearson gives you a quantitative measure of the degree of linear relationship between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Spearman Correlation:\n",
    "- **When the relationship is monotonic**: Use Spearman when you suspect a monotonic relationship (i.e., as one variable increases, the other variable either consistently increases or decreases, but not necessarily in a linear fashion).\n",
    "- **When the data is not normally distributed**: Spearman correlation does not require the data to be normally distributed, making it more appropriate for skewed data.\n",
    "- **When the data is ordinal**: If the variables are measured on an ordinal scale (e.g., rankings), Spearman correlation is more appropriate because it works with ranked data rather than raw values.\n",
    "- **When there are outliers**: Spearman correlation is less sensitive to outliers because it uses ranks instead of actual data values. So, if your dataset contains significant outliers, Spearman is a better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Pearson** when:\n",
    "  - You need to measure the strength and direction of a linear relationship.\n",
    "  - The data is continuous, normally distributed, and you are looking for a linear association.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Use Spearman** when:\n",
    "  - You are dealing with non-linear but monotonic relationships.\n",
    "  - The data is not normally distributed or is ordinal in nature.\n",
    "  - You want a correlation measure that is less sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pearson** is powerful for analyzing linear relationships and is the preferred method when assumptions (such as normality and linearity) are met.\n",
    "- **Spearman** is more robust, suitable for non-linear relationships, and works better with non-parametric or ordinal data.\n"
