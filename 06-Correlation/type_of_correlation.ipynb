    "# **Types of Correlation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation is a statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are related. Below are the main types of correlation:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Positive Correlation**\n",
    "- **Definition**: As one variable increases, the other variable also increases.\n",
    "- **Example**: Height and weight (taller people tend to weigh more).\n",
    "- **Correlation Coefficient**: Positive values close to +1 (e.g., 0.8, 0.9).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Negative Correlation**\n",
    "- **Definition**: As one variable increases, the other variable decreases.\n",
    "- **Example**: Temperature and the amount of hot coffee sold (as temperature rises, coffee sales decrease).\n",
    "- **Correlation Coefficient**: Negative values close to -1 (e.g., -0.7, -0.8).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Zero (No) Correlation**\n",
    "- **Definition**: No relationship exists between the two variables; changes in one variable do not affect the other.\n",
    "- **Example**: Shoe size and intelligence.\n",
    "- **Correlation Coefficient**: Close to 0 (e.g., -0.1, +0.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Linear Correlation**\n",
    "- **Definition**: The relationship between two variables can be represented by a straight line.\n",
    "- **Example**: The number of hours studied and exam scores.\n",
    "- **Methods**: Measured using Pearson’s correlation coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Non-Linear (Curvilinear) Correlation**\n",
    "- **Definition**: The relationship between variables follows a curve rather than a straight line.\n",
    "- **Example**: The stress level vs. performance (performance increases with moderate stress but decreases with excessive stress).\n",
    "- **Methods**: Typically not measured with Pearson’s coefficient but using Spearman’s or other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Pearson Correlation Coefficient**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Measures the linear relationship between two continuous variables.\n",
    "- **Range**: -1 to +1.\n",
    "  - **+1**: Perfect positive linear correlation.\n",
    "  - **-1**: Perfect negative linear correlation.\n",
    "  - **0**: No linear correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7. Spearman Rank Correlation**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Measures the relationship between two ranked (ordinal) variables.\n",
    "- **When to Use**: When data is not normally distributed or has non-linear relationships.\n",
    "- **Range**: -1 to +1.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **8. Kendall Tau Correlation**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Measures the strength and direction of association between two ranked variables.\n",
    "- **When to Use**: For smaller datasets or data with tied ranks.\n",
    "- **Range**: -1 to +1.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **9. Partial Correlation**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Measures the correlation between two variables while controlling for the effect of other variables.\n",
    "- **Example**: Correlation between exercise and weight loss, controlling for calorie intake.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **10. Point-Biserial Correlation**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Measures the relationship between a continuous variable and a binary variable.\n",
    "- **Example**: Test scores (continuous) and gender (binary).\n",
