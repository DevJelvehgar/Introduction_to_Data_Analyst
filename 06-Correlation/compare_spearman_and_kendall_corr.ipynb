    "| **Definition**            | Measures the monotonic relationship between two variables by calculating the correlation of their ranks.    | Measures the ordinal association between two variables based on the proportion of concordant and discordant pairs. |\n",
    "| **Calculation**           | Based on the ranks of the variables, using the Pearson formula on ranked data.                             | Based on concordant and discordant pairs in the data.                                                        |\n",

    "| **Sensitivity to Outliers**| Moderately sensitive to outliers (depends on rank transformation).                                         | Less sensitive to outliers due to pairwise comparisons rather than rank differences.                         |\n",
