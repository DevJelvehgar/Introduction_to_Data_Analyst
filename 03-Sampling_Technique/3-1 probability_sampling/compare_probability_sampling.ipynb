    "| **Simple Random Sampling** | Every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected.       | - Minimizes bias<br>- Easy to understand and implement                                            | - Requires a complete list of the population<br>- Can be time-consuming for large populations         | When population is small and a complete list of individuals is available.                            |\n",
    "| **Systematic Sampling**    | Selects every k-th individual from a population list, starting at a random point. | - Simple to execute<br>- Ensures even coverage across the population                              | - Can introduce bias if there is a pattern in the population<br>- Less effective for heterogeneous populations | When population is homogeneous or arranged randomly.                                                  |\n",
    "| **Cluster Sampling**       | Population is divided into clusters, some clusters are randomly selected, and all members of those clusters are sampled. | - Cost-effective<br>- Feasible for large or dispersed populations                                 | - Higher sampling error<br>- Risk of bias if selected clusters are not representative                 | When population is geographically dispersed, or when a complete list of individuals is unavailable.   |\n",
    "| **Multistage Sampling**    | Sampling is conducted in multiple stages, narrowing the population at each stage. | - Cost-efficient for large populations<br>- Flexible<br>- Scalable                                | - Cumulative sampling error<br>- Requires careful planning to avoid bias                             | Large-scale surveys, geographically dispersed populations, or populations with hierarchical structures. |\n",
    "| **Stratified Sampling**    | Population is divided into subgroups (strata), and samples are taken proportionally from each stratum. | - Ensures representation of all subgroups<br>- Reduces sampling error                             | - Requires detailed knowledge of population strata<br>- More complex and time-consuming               | When subgroup representation is crucial or when population is highly heterogeneous.                   |\n"
