    "## What is Inferential Statistics?\n",
    "Inferential Statistics involves using a sample of data to draw conclusions or make inferences about a larger population. Instead of examining every member of a population, inferential statistics relies on mathematical techniques to estimate population parameters, test hypotheses, and predict outcomes."

    "    1.1 Point Estimation: Provides a single value estimate for a population parameter (e.g., sample mean as an estimate of population mean).<br>\n",
    "    1.2 Interval Estimation (Confidence Intervals): Provides a range of values within which the parameter is likely to fall.\n",

    "    Tests assumptions or claims about a population parameter.\n",

    "    2.1 Z-test: Used for population means when the sample size is large or population variance is known.<br>\n",
    "    2.2 T-test: Used when the sample size is small and variance is unknown.<br>\n",
    "    2.3 Chi-Square Test: For testing relationships between categorical variables.<br>\n",
